<b>What was the goal for last week..

Build first version of a playable game

<b>What I actually did last week..

First version of playable game not completed

<b>What I am doing this week..

Finish first working build of the game (Add ropes and build gameplay)

<b>What I am doing next week..

Brainstorm on how to improve the current level

Add more props/power-ups to the first level

<b>Goals for the rest of the game.. 

Add animations

Figure out how to make the game more interesting and implement it

<b>What was the goal for last week..

Finish first working build of the game (Add ropes and build gameplay)

<b>What I actually did last week..

First version of playable game not completed

Added animations to the monkey

Revised approach to building ropes

Facing issues with rendering the rope texture as gaps are appearing between rope segemnts

Joints not being anchored at the right place and need to build ropes programmatically

<b>What I am doing this week..

Finish first working build of the game.

Concentrate on getting the game mechanics to work to make a playable build rather than getting the textures right.

<b>What I am doing next week..

Brainstorm on how to improve the current level

Add more props/power-ups to the first level

<b>Goals for the rest of the game.. 

Add animations

Figure out how to make the game more interesting and implement it



#Date: April 7th 2015

<b>What was the goal for last week..

Finish first working build of the game (Add ropes and build gameplay)

<b>What I actually did last week..

Got the rope mechanics to work

Joints and ropes instantiated programmatically

Added animations to monkey jumps

First version of playable game completed (Monkey can jump from rope to rope)

<b>What I am doing this week..

Improve the physics joint so that the monkey's jump looks smoother

Change image of rope to make it look more real

Add parallax and infinite background loop

<b>What I am doing next week..

Brainstorm on how to improve the current level

Add more props/power-ups to the first level

<b>Goals for the rest of the game.. 

Add variety to the gameplay - increased difficulty/different actions apart from rope hopping

Figure out how to make the game more interesting



#Date: April 14th 2015

<b>What was the goal for last week..

Improve the physics joint so that the monkey's jump looks smoother

Change image of rope to make it look more real

Add infinite background loop

<b>What I actually did last week..

Improved the physics and resolved a problem with the collision delegate firing multiple times for a single collision causing unintended joints.

<b>What I am doing this week..

Brainstorm on how to improve the current level

Add more props/power-ups to the first level

<b>What I am doing next week..

Add variety to the gameplay - increased difficulty/different actions apart from rope hopping

<b>Goals for the rest of the game.. 

Improve the finish of the game



#Date: April 21st 2015

<b>What was the goal for last week..

Brainstorm on how to improve the current level

Add more props/power-ups to the first level

Add infinite background loop

<b>What I actually did last week..

Created a working infinite loop along with dynamically created joints

Improvement on current level - Made game infinite, changed the theme of the game 
to the monkey escaping the burning forest

Added particle fire effects, rope and game timers to implement new theme

<b>What I am doing this week..

Variable rope lengths

Swipe gestures instead of tap

Add artifacts to gameplay


<b>What I am doing next week..

Add more artifacts to increase engagement

Improve the finish of the game

<b>Goals for the rest of the game.. 

Improve the finish of the game
